== Purpose

This tap contains formulas for the installation of
https://www.metanorma.org[Metanorma].


== Install Metanorma using Homebrew

[source,sh]
----
# Without installing the Metanorma tap
brew install metanorma/metanorma/metanorma

# or
# Install the Metanorma tap then install Metanorma
brew tap metanorma/metanorma
brew install metanorma
----


== Formulas

=== General

This tap provides the following Metanorma formulas:

* `metanorma`: Pre-compiled binary distribution. This is suitable for most users
and is the recommended installation method. The binary distribution is released
every 2 weeks.

* `metanorma-dev`: Source distribution for development. This is for developers
who need the latest features that are not available in the binary distribution.

=== `metanorma` formula

The `metanorma` formula installs pre-compiled binaries from the
https://github.com/metanorma/packed-mn[packed-mn] repository.

This is the recommended installation method being much faster and does not
require compilation.

* **Source**: Pre-compiled binaries from packed-mn releases
* **Installation time**: Fast (no compilation required)
* **Dependencies**: Minimal system dependencies
* **Platforms**: macOS (ARM64/x86_64), Linux (x86_64/aarch64)

[source,sh]
----
# Install development version
brew install metanorma/metanorma/metanorma
----

=== `metanorma-dev` formula

The `metanorma-dev` formula builds Metanorma from source using the
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-cli[metanorma-cli] repository.

This formula is suitable when you need the latest features that are not
yet provided in the binary distribution.

WARNING: This formula requires a Ruby development environment and build tools.

* **Source**: Built from `metanorma-cli` source code
* **Installation time**: Slower (requires compilation)
* **Dependencies**: Ruby, build tools, and gem dependencies
* **Use case**: Development, testing, or when binary distribution is unavailable

[source,sh]
----
# Install development version
brew install metanorma/metanorma/metanorma-dev
----

== Formula updates

=== General

This repository uses an automated formula generation system to maintain
consistency and simplify updates.

=== Architecture

The formula generation system consists of:

* **Templates** (`templates/`): ERB templates for each formula.

* **Metadata** (`formula-metadata.json`): Version information and SHA256 hashes.
This file is automatically updated with each release.

* **Generator** (`generate-formula.rb`): Script that combines templates with
metadata.

=== Generating formulas

To update the formulae with a new version:

[source,sh]
----
# Update metadata for a specific version
bundle exec ruby generate-formula.rb --version v1.23.2

# Dry run to preview changes
bundle exec ruby generate-formula.rb --dry-run
----

The generator script will:

. Fetch SHA256 hashes from GitHub Releases of packed-mn
. Update the `formula-metadata.json` file with new version and SHA256
. Generate new formulae from templates

=== Manual updates

If you need to manually update metadata:

. Edit `formula-metadata.json` to update version numbers
. Run `bundle exec ruby generate-formula.rb` to regenerate formulae
. Test the formulae locally
. Commit and push changes

=== Template structure

Templates use ERB syntax and have access to the `metadata` hash:

[source,ruby]
----
url "<%= metadata['packed_mn']['url'] %>"
sha256 "<%= metadata['packed_mn']['sha256'] %>"
----

Static information (description, dependencies, etc.) is hardcoded in templates
for better maintainability.
